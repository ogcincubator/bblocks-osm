$comment: 'Notes:

  - Enumerations reflect commonly documented values on the OSM wiki (Map features
  + Key:highway).

  - Many specialized keys (e.g., lanes:forward/backward, maxspeed:conditional) are
  omitted for simplicity.

  - Consider replacing tight enums with patterns or merging editor presets for broader
  coverage.
